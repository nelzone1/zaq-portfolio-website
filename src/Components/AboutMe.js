            I am a multi-skilled agile software developer with over 5 years of experience in SDLC, from product ownership to programming. I have a bachelor’s in Statistics and
            a strong knowledge of business development.
            <br/>
            <br/>I demonstrate extreme comfortability using numerous Java frameworks, such as Spring, Hibernate, JDBC and Agular. I am capable of building python applications
            using Django and Flask frameworks, and have knowledge of cloud computing with the 3 major platforms, Azure, AWS and Google. I freelance in the meantime,
            currently working on two interesting projects. One is a long distance rideshare app, and the other is a food bundling delivery app.
            <br/>
            <br/>When I’m not working, I spend a lot of time with my family. The ‘Squad’ loves travelling, regardless of the means, and we do this at every opportunity. My
            sincere desire is to continue to use the right platforms to showcase my creative ability and passion for programming.
