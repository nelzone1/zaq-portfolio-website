    <div className='about-me'>
      I am a multi-skilled agile software developer with over 5 years of experience in SDLC, from product ownership to programming. I have a bachelor’s in Statistics and
      a strong knowledge of business development. My passion for analyses has sculptured me into a very data driven individual. Asides my traditionally schooling, I
      am also a graduate of various software developer programs in Java, Python, and JavaScript. I have perfectly transferred my learning to actual productive application
      in various completed projects. I demonstrate extreme comfortability using numerous Java frameworks, such as Spring, Hibernate, JDBC and Agular. I am capable of
      building python applications using Django and Flask frameworks, and have knowledge of cloud computing with the 3 major platforms, Azure, AWS and Google. I freelance
      in the meantime, currently working on two interesting projects. One is a long distance rideshare app, and the other is a food bundling delivery app. When I’m not
      working, I spend a lot of time with my family. The ‘Squad’ loves travelling, regardless of the means, and we do this at every opportunity. My sincere desire is
      to continue to use the right platforms to showcase my creative ability and passion for programming.
